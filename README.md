# Welcome to your CDK JavaScript project!

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`FirstCallStack`)
which builds the basics of a Chime SDK app that answers the phone, plays a recording, and hangs up.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. The build step is not required when using JavaScript.

## Tutorial  
See [this useful workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/20-typescript.html) on working with the AWS CDK for Typescript projects.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run test`         perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
